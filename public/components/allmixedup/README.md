# Be Careful, We've Been All Mixed Up

put all goodies here, only thing left was include them in proper way, below is a note


In main layout, there should be

```javascript

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="components/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="components/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="components/css/docs.css" />

<script type="text/javascript" src="components/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/js/spine.js"></script>

```

Don't forget you are building an app, not playing toys. Good luck.
